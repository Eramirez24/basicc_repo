Steps taken to upload to Github.
Sent to github and made a repo called basic repo.
Opened gitbash and went to my coding folder using cd and ls commands.
Once in my coding folder I used mkdir to make a new directory and touch to create new files.
Once i added content to all files I git init.
I added the files by using git add . and then checked the status by using get status.
Then i commited the files by using git commit -m 'initial commit'.
Used command git branch -m main.
Then used git remote add origin to upload to git.
And pused files by using command git push -u origin main.
I logged in to github and made sure my files were upladed and they were.
